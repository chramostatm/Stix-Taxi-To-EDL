Innovation & Creativity
- Personaly I have no ground to consider the creativity of my project. Most of my work seemed to revolve around finding resources/documentation for the Stix side and then playing around with object and string manipulation

Problem Solved
- Does the project (attempt to) solve an important problem?
In the world of Network Security the Primary and sometimes only defense. EDLs (or External Dynamic lists) are a way to block (and sometimes allow). PaloAlto's had an open-source repo meant to help with the however it was noted that the repo was "trash" and last updated 5+ years ago which doesn't account for the new v2.0 and v2.1 specifications for TAXII/STIX.

Completeness
- How complete is the project?
Personally I couldn't quite finish/verify the client server example. I think I create a decent skeleton but I hit a snag with Alienvault with a 500 internal server error, I emailed my Business friends in the MS-ISAC for STIX recommendations or exampale test servers Friday before the competition (without a response during the Hackathon).

Solution Quality
- How effective is the project at solving the problem?
    Mostly up to the. The main ask was creating a python script that would find URL and IP indicators and send it off to a newline text file that would be synced with a Firewall EDL policy.
